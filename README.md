This program auto updates devonian to latest actions with one single click 



To make this program work, you must tell it where your Minecraft folder is located on your computer.
In the code, you will see this line:

`MODS_FOLDER = r"minecraft folder path here"`

You need to replace the text inside the quotes with the full path to your Minecraft mods folder.

Examples of path: 

`MODS_FOLDER = r"C:\Users\Alex\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods"`

`MODS_FOLDER = r"C:\Users\Alex\Documents\CurseForge\Minecraft\Instances\MyModpack\mods"`

`MODS_FOLDER = r"C:\Users\Alex\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\instances\Fabric 1.21\mods"`
